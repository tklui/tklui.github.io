			<p>Stuff I have yet to actually write, I'm just typing this so that I have something to go off of when I am judging how good this format looks.  I am thinking of using ariel right now, so that should be the font this is displayed in.  I'm going to go with black text on a white background for now, but once I actually get the contents of this built I am probably going to format the site a little differently, I might try out very light grey on very dark greyish blue.
