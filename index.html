<h2>WHY DOGS ARE GOOD</h2>
<p>Dogs are my favorite animals, due to their unquenchable love, steadfast loyalty, and irresistable cuteness.  The first, and perhaps most important traits that I feel raises them above all other animals, is the fact that they are actually in love with you.  Other animals, such as cats and dolphins and birds that are other common "best animals" simply cannot compete with the sheer adoration dogs are capable of.  Cats are obviously out for only themselves, dolphins may find you interesting but the only way to make one stay is to lock it up, and birds are too unlike humans to make attributing love to them for us not really viable in an argument.  Humans can love other humans, though, which makes them the most obvious contenders for best animal, but the next point shows how humans are lacking.  A dog will never abaondon you, and they will protect you no matter what.  The breed of the dog matters, of course, but essentially all dogs will go through almost any ordeal for you, regardless of danger it puts them in.  Finally, dogs are arguably the cutest animals.  Cats can be cute at times, but when a little golden puppy snuggles up with you you know without a doubt that they are the most cute single beings on the planet.  That's why dogs are the best animals.  I'm gong to finish this paragraph now, though, and check to see how close I am to the end of the page, so if this is the end you'll know I've hit it.</p>
<p>Turns out that, no, I have most certaintly not.  One way I came up with of expiditing this process, however, is by making a list to take up a bunch of horizontal space.  I don't actually know how to make a list, scratch that I just googled it, so here goes the best continents in terms of how pretty I think they are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>North America - Contains all of my favorite biomes</li>
  <li>Oceana - New Zealand is amazing, and I'd love to swim in the great barrier reefs.</li>
  <li>Europe - I've not been to many impressive places here, but I've seen pictures from places in Northern Europe that are mind-blowing.</li>
  <li>Africa - I've not been to Africa at all, but the nature documentaries in Africa are stunning as well</li>
  <li>Asia - I don't know quite as much about the geography of mainland Asia, but I know several places here that are amazing as well</li>
  <li>South America - I don't know much about here, either, besides Machu Pichu which is definitly glorious.</li>
  <li>Antarctica - I would love to come here, but due to it being a massive bleak wasteland it has some obvious drawbacks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that I've wote that list, I've realized half a dozen exeptions that would put some of the bottom ones at the top.  I really just think the world is too large and full of pretty things to rank them by something as large and arbitrary as continents.  It didn't even extend that far down, which was the reason I wrote it.  This is the place where I should probably paste in some filler text, but that's not really my style.  Here are my favorite colors, ranked as well:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Blue</li>
  <li>Red</li>
  <li>Green</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
  <li>Yellow</li>
  <li>Purple</li>
</ol>
