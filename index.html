<h2>Malware Injection Site</h2>
<p>By coming here, you have been injected with malware :)<p>
<p>For legal reasons, and I actually mean that, I don't think I can not put a disclaimer that says that that was a joke.  I would also like to clarify that I am not actually injecting you with malware, rather, I am just messing around with formatting for my web design class.  EVen as I type this paragraph, in fact, I am really just trying to get the word cound higher so I can test this style of formatting.  Because there is not a whole lot of stuff to be said on this specific topic, and even less that would be advisiable, I am gong to start a new paragraph about dogs.</p>
<p>Dos are my favorite animals, due to their unquenchable love, steadfast loyalty, and irresistable cuteness.  The first, and perhaps most important traits that I feel raises them above all other animals, is the fact that they are actually in love with you.  Other animals, such as cats and dolphins and birds that are other common "best animals" simply cannot compete with the sheer adoration dogs are capable of.  Cats are obviously out for only themselves, dolphins may find you interesting but the only way to make one stay is to lock it up, and birds are too unlike humans to make attributing love to them for us not really viable in an argument.  Humans can love other humans, though, which makes them the most obvious contenders for best animal, but the next point shows how humans are lacking.  A dog will never abaondon you, and they will protect you no matter what.  The breed of the dog matters, of course, but essentially all dogs will go through almost any ordeal for you, regardless of danger it puts them in.  Finally, dogs are arguably the cutest animals.  Cats can be cute at times, but when a little golden puppy snuggles up with you you know without a doubt that they are the most cute single beings on the planet.  That's why dogs are the best animals.  I'm gong to finish this paragraph now, though, and check to see how close I am to the end of the page, so if this is the end you'll know I've hit it.
